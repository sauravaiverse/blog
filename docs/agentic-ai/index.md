# Introduction to Agentic AI

## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act autonomously to achieve specific goals. These AI agents can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions without constant human supervision.

## Key Characteristics

### Autonomy
- Independent decision-making
- Self-directed task execution
- Goal-oriented behavior

### Intelligence
- Problem-solving capabilities
- Learning from experience
- Adaptive responses

### Interaction
- Communication with other agents
- Human-AI collaboration
- Environment interaction

## Core Components

### 1. Perception
- Sensor integration
- Environment understanding
- State awareness

### 2. Decision Making
- Goal evaluation
- Action planning
- Risk assessment

### 3. Action Execution
- Task implementation
- Resource management
- Result monitoring
