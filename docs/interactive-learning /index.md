# Interactive Learning

Interactive learning is a hands-on approach to understanding AI concepts through practical experimentation and real-time feedback. Our platform offers several interactive features to enhance your learning experience.

## AI Playground

The AI Playground is an interactive environment where you can:

- Experiment with different AI models in real-time
- Adjust model parameters and see immediate results
- Test prompts and analyze responses
- Compare outputs across different models

### Features
- Live code execution
- Real-time model output
- Parameter tuning interface
- Response visualization

## Performance Benchmarks

Our benchmarks section allows you to:

- Compare different AI models side-by-side
- Analyze performance metrics
- Test models with your own inputs
- Understand trade-offs between models

### Metrics Tracked
