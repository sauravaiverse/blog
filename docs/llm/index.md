# 🤖 What is Generative AI and LLMs? 🌟  

[Watch: Introduction to Generative AI and LLMs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/shows/generative-ai-for-beginners/introduction-to-generative-ai-and-llms-generative-ai-for-beginners?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)  

**Generative AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of creating **new content**—such as text, images, audio, or code—by learning patterns from existing data. These systems use advanced machine learning models, particularly **deep learning algorithms**, to understand and replicate structures found in their training datasets. For example:  
- **DALL-E** generates images from text descriptions. 🖼️  
- **ChatGPT** produces human-like text responses based on input prompts. 💬  

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are a subset of generative AI focused on **processing and generating human language**. Trained on vast amounts of text data, LLMs can perform tasks like:  
- Text generation 📝  
- Translation 🌍  
- Summarization 📄  
- Question-answering ❓  

Notable examples include **OpenAI's GPT series** and **Google's BERT**.  

In summary, **generative AI** creates new content across various formats, while **LLMs** specialize in understanding and generating human language, making them a key part of the generative AI ecosystem. 🌐
